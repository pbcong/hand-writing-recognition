Approach:
1. Load image data from a csv file using pandas
2. Explore the dataset:
   - plotting some sample
   - plotting the number of sample for each letter
3. Prepare data:
   - Scaling thhe piixel values
   - Using train_test_split to split data into train and test batches
4. Building the CNN model
5. Save [model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7bkPKbPlV1i7tAbtPvWJTGP_johdHcD/view?usp=sharing)
